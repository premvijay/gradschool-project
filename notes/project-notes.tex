\section{15th June 2020}

\subsection{Basic reading}
Dodelson ch-7. Inhomogeneities : reproduce the plot in figure 7.11 using the BBKS transfer function - read the whole chapter and reproduce other plots.

\subsection{Advanced reading}
Read the introduction of \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09906.pdf} and summarize it.

\subsection{Try N-body sims}
Do a particle mesh code following the tutorial by Andrey Kravstov \url{https://astro.uchicago.edu/~andrey/Talks/PM/pm.pdf}

\section{Large Scale Structure notes}

Inhomonenous evolution can't be done completely analytically, eventhough it can be simulated. Analytical tools/models are important to gain deeper understanding.  Simulations help in making, testing and refining these analytical tools along with the observations.\\
