\section{Introduction}
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shows that the Universe was homogenous initially with very small inhomogeneities. On the other hand, the universe we see today not only has galaxies but also a lot of interesting structures well beyond the galactic scale. This foam-like large scale structure of the universe is called the cosmic web.
